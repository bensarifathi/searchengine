# Search Engine with Spring Boot

The goal of this project is to implement a book repository search engine using the following algorithms:

- **Text Lookup:**
  - KMP algorithm (Knuth–Morris–Pratt) for simple lookup
  - Regex custom implementation for regex lookup

- **Result Ordering:**
  - Generating Graph links with Jaccard Similarity algorithm
  - DFS/BFS for graph traversal
  - Degree centrality
  - Closeness centrality
  - Betweeness centrality
  - PageRank
